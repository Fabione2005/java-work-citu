I was helping Pratyusha and Jaswanth gathering info of our APIS of some PIIDs of SOW, for the story DLAB-12412
Also got the story UESS-228 assigned which its more like a discovery story to research a possible change on CLarity tool
and i have been having some trouble doing the testing for the citi-utilities, as the coverage was very low and the classes have complex logic, but im almost done, just need to be focus today on that

"I have been experiencing issues with SSO for some time. Last week, I reviewed the emails and attempted to access the course, but I continued facing the same SSO problem. I tried resetting my SSO password several times that day without success. On that same day, I was also assigned another urgent task that required my immediate attention, and I believe I overlooked the course matter afterward.

That said, I know this is not an excuse and I acknowledge that it was wrong. I sincerely apologize and assure you it will not happen again."
