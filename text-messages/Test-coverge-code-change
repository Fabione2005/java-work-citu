I identified that the condition inside the catch (Exception ex) block:

if (ex instanceof HttpServerErrorException) { ... }


was dead code and could never be executed.

Why it was unreachable

HttpServerErrorException is a subclass of HttpStatusCodeException.

The method has a catch (HttpStatusCodeException hscse) placed before the general catch (Exception ex).

Because Java processes catch blocks in order, any HttpServerErrorException will always be captured by the first catch (HttpStatusCodeException) and will never reach the generic catch(Exception) block.

Therefore, the instanceof HttpServerErrorException branch was logically impossible to execute, making it unreachable and untestable.

What change was made

I removed only the unreachable instanceof HttpServerErrorException condition inside the generic catch block.
This is a minimal and safe cleanup that:

Does not change the functional behavior of the service.

Keeps all existing exception handling logic intact.

Removes dead code that could never be covered by tests.

Improves maintainability and clarity.

Impact

No runtime behavior changes.

No logging changes for valid exception cases.

Test coverage can now reflect the actual reachable logic.
