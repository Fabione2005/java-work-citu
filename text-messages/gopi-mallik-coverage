Hi Gopi, hi Mallik,

I hope you’re both doing well. I wanted to share an update regarding the recent request from upper management to achieve 100% test coverage across all our team’s services and applications, with a delivery deadline of November 30th.

On the services side, Mohan Prasad and I are currently working on this task. However, we still have several services pending, and realistically, even with the help of GitHub Copilot, reaching 100% coverage within the expected timeframe doesn’t seem achievable.

I’ve also heard that the Angular team is facing the same situation, and their lead (Brody) will be reaching out to the team handling the request to discuss extending the deadline or allowing some flexibility, since they also won’t be able to reach 100% coverage by November 30th.

Given this context, we wanted to ask for your support as well. If possible, we would appreciate your help in requesting additional time or a lower required coverage percentage, so that we can meet the expectations in a realistic and sustainable way.

Please let us know your thoughts.

Thanks a lot!
