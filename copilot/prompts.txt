Write a full JUnit 5 test class for the following Java POJO.  
Generate one test method for each getter and setter.  
Each test should be as simple as possible: create an instance of the class, set a value using the setter, and assert that the getter returns the expected value.  
Do not use any mocks or additional libraries â€” just basic JUnit 5.  
Name each test method like: testGet[PropertyName] or testSet[PropertyName].  
Give me the complete test class.
